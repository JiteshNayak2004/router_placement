Efficient Router Placement Project
Introduction
This project aims to develop an algorithm that can determine the most efficient placement of routers in a given area to ensure optimal Wi-Fi coverage. The algorithm takes into account factors such as signal strength, interference, and user density to recommend the best placement for the routers.
